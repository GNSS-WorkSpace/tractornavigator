# Tractor Navigator

App for Galileo App Challenge 2019.

Tractor navigator provides guidance for farmers driving tractors. It is a navigation app (like your car
gps) that enables you to:

- Visualize current position and trajectory on an open field (no road)
- Follow accurately a predefined trajectory with live feedback to correct deviation
- Record and load saved trajectories to pick up work from where you left and avoid passing
two times in the same area
